// This script attempts to directly test the submitContactForm function
// But since it's a server action, this is just for reference
// NOTE: Server actions can't be directly called from Node.js scripts
// You need to test this through the actual web form

// For reference, this is what we would do if it were a regular function
// that could be called from a script:

/*
const { submitContactForm } = require('../app/actions/contact');

async function testContactForm() {
  console.log('Testing contact form submission...');
  
  const testData = {
    name: 'Test User',
    email: 'test@example.com',
    subject: 'Test Contact Form',
    message: 'This is a test message sent from test-end-to-end.js script at ' + new Date().toLocaleString(),
    ip: '127.0.0.1'
  };
  
  try {
    console.log('Submitting form data:', testData);
    const result = await submitContactForm(testData);
    console.log('Result:', result);
    
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('✅ Form submission successful!');
    } else {
      console.log('❌ Form submission failed:', result.message);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error submitting form:', error);
  }
}

testContactForm();

        CONTACT FORM TESTING GUIDELINES
====================================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
-------------------------------
Frequent testing with email forms can trigger account suspensions.
Your account was previously suspended and required a password reset.
To avoid this happening again, follow these guidelines:

1. Minimal Testing:
   - Test only when absolutely necessary
   - Limit to 1-2 form submissions per day during testing
   - Allow several minutes between tests

2. Normal Usage:
   - For normal development, you can start your Next.js server:
     > npx next dev
   
   - Open the contact page in your browser:
     http://localhost:3000/contact
   
   - But AVOID submitting the form repeatedly during development

3. When Testing Is Needed:
   - Fill out the form with realistic test data
   - Submit ONCE and check for success message
   - Check your email inbox (including spam folder)
   - Wait at least 10 minutes before testing again

4. If You Must Run Port Tests:
   - The test scripts are now disabled by default
   - Only enable testing when absolutely necessary
   - Follow the instructions in each test script

====================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE CODE:
-----------------------------
- Password has been updated in all files
- Rate limiting has been added to prevent rapid submissions
- Testing scripts have been disabled by default
