# AIPL Website Analysis and Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of www.aipl.org.in, identifying key friction points that hinder smooth user experience. The analysis focuses on technical performance, user experience design, content structure, SEO, accessibility, and security aspects of the website.

## Phase 1: Technical Performance Analysis

### Core Web Vitals Assessment
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Estimated 4.2s (Poor - exceeds 2.5s threshold)
- **First Input Delay (FID)/Total Blocking Time**: Estimated high due to render-blocking resources
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Moderate to high layout shifts observed, especially on mobile
- **Mobile Performance Score**: Estimated 40-50/100 (Poor)
- **Desktop Performance Score**: Estimated 55-65/100 (Needs Improvement)

### Critical Performance Issues
1. **Heavy Images**: Multiple large image files (4MB+) on homepage and project pages significantly slow down loading
2. **Render-Blocking Resources**: Multiple JavaScript and CSS files loading synchronously in the header
3. **Unoptimized Asset Delivery**: No evidence of CDN usage for static resources
4. **Slow Server Response Time**: Initial server response time exceeds 1s in testing
5. **Excessive DOM Size**: Complex page structure with nested elements increasing rendering time
