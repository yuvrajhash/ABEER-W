### Transitions
- Content fade-in effects when scrolling (150-300ms duration)
- Smooth page transitions (250-400ms)
- Subtle scale animations for interactive elements

### Hover Effects
- Gentle lift effect on cards (transform: translateY(-3px))
- Color transitions (200-300ms)
- Soft glow effects on primary CTA buttons

### Scroll Effects
- Parallax scrolling for hero sections (subtle)
- Reveal animations for important content blocks
- Fixed navigation that changes opacity on scroll

## Medical-Specific Elements

### Icons & Graphics
- Line-style medical icons with orange and green color accents
- Simplified anatomical graphics where relevant
- Animated graphs and charts for medical data
- Health/wellness oriented illustrations 

### Status Indicators
- Green for positive/healthy states
- Orange for warnings or items needing attention
- Red reserved only for critical alerts

### Dashboards
- Clean white background with dark green headers
- Orange highlights for important metrics
- Animated charts and graphs with smooth data transitions
- Card-based layout for different information sections

## Implementation Guidelines

### CSS Framework Adjustments
- Override default theme variables in your framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
- Implement custom CSS properties for color themes:
```css
:root {
  --primary-green: #0A5F55;
  --primary-orange: #FF7F41;
  --white: #FFFFFF;
  --light-green: #11897A;
  --dark-green: #054640;
  --light-orange: #FFA67E;
  --off-white: #F5F7F6;
  --dark-gray: #333333;
}
```

### Animation Libraries
- Consider integration of:
  - GSAP for complex animations
  - AOS (Animate On Scroll) for scroll-based reveals
  - Framer Motion (for React projects)
  - Lottie for more complex animated illustrations

### Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios between text and backgrounds
- Provide alternative animation paths for users with vestibular disorders
- Include focus states for keyboard navigation
- Test color combinations for color blindness compatibility

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load animations and effects
- Use CSS transitions where possible instead of JavaScript
- Optimize SVGs for medical icons and illustrations
- Consider reduced motion media queries for users who prefer minimal animation

## Layout Structures

### Homepage
- Hero section with animated medical illustration or abstract visualization
- Card-based feature overview with hover animations
- Testimonial carousel with smooth transitions
- Statistics section with counting animations

### Dashboard/Portal Pages
- Sidebar navigation (dark green) with white text and orange indicators
- Card-based layout for different metrics and information
- Collapsible sections with smooth animations
- Tabbed interfaces with sliding indicators

### Mobile Considerations
- Bottom navigation in dark green with orange active indicators
- Collapsible cards for information density
- Pull-to-refresh with themed animation
- Touch-optimized buttons (min. 44Ã—44px touch targets)
